Lani is an advanced AI-driven network assistant designed to help you monitor, analyze, and secure your network effortlessly. Whether you need real-time device status updates, bandwidth monitoring, open port detection, or live traffic analysis, Lani provides precise and actionable insights.

Powered by Nmap, Lani scans your network to detect devices and open ports, ensuring comprehensive visibility. It leverages a BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to analyze user queries, accurately identifying dynamic values like IP addresses, device names, ports, and other network-related entities.

Lani dynamically extracts these values from your queries and injects them into response placeholders, ensuring accurate, context-aware, and relevant information for each interaction.
